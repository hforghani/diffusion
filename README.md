# Information Diffusion in Social Networks

This repository contains the implementation of some latest network diffusion models including:

- AsLT
- CTIC
- EMIC
- DAIC

In addition, provides base classes to implement IC (Independent Cascades) and LT (Linear Thresholds) diffusion models.
The novel models

- SPCRF
- LPCRF
- SPMEMM
- LPMEMM

are also proposed and implemented by the owner of this repository. They are based on CRF and MEMM, two probabilistic 
graphical models. The work is submitted as a publication with the title "An Interpretable Diffusion Prediction Model 
Based on Sequence Labeling Models".
